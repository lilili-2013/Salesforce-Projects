In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity or (iv) if this is necessary to protect the vital interests of the a person.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your information with third parties and among our affiliates for their marketing purposes, if the affiliates are separate legal entities.

<!--<p>The information sharing practices described in this privacy policy apply to our current and potential customers, users of our internet sites, recipients of surveys or marketing information, and boating enthusiasts.</p>

<h4>POLICY JURISDICTION</h4>
<p>Both the General Privacy Policy and this Canadian Privacy Policy (the "Canadian Policy") apply to citizens of Canada except that, for such persons (and only for such persons), where the provisions of the General Privacy Policy and the Canadian Policy cannot be construed consistently, the Canadian Policy will govern.   </p>

<h4>CANADIAN PRIVACY STANDARD</h4>
<p>The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA") imposes requirements regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in relation to our commercial activities, as does private-sector privacy legislation in Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.</p>

<p>This Canadian Policy applies to all personal information about you that we collect, hold, use and disclose, regardless of  the way in which we collect it (i.e. whether through a site or otherwise). </p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Under federal Canadian privacy laws (and in this Canadian Policy), personal information is generally any information about an identifiable individual. It may include your name, age, mailing address, residential phone number, or e-mail address, and personal history, including income, financial, credit, and family information, billing history, and information concerning your purchases with our companies. The term, personal information, does not include your name, business title, business address, or business telephone number in your capacity as an employee of an organization or enterprise.</p>

<h4>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We collect personal information from correspondence, product registration cards, surveys, faxes, e-mails, telephone inquiries, web forms, and other means of communication.  We collect such information when you order or agree to purchase or avail yourself of goods or services, as well as in the case of registrations to track warranty rights and obligations, to provide product information (whether with regard to recalls or otherwise), and other lawful purposes. We often collect personal information from you or from third parties and as agents on behalf of third parties, where we have obtained the requisite consent to do so or as otherwise permitted by law. Third parties include, as examples, organizations for whom we provide services to you or on your behalf, organizations that perform outsourcing and other services for us. SEA RAY WILL NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SUBJECT YOU TO TELE-MARKETING OR UNSOLICITED E-MAIL</p>

<h4>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

<p>When supplementary disclosure is required, we will identify (at the time we collect such information from you and obtain the requisite consent to such disclosure, unless otherwise permitted by law) the other persons, organizations, and/or enterprises and the other purposes to whom and for which disclosure may occur.</p>

<h4>OBTAINING CONSENT</h4>
<p>Except when otherwise permitted by law, we obtain the requisite consent prior to collecting and, in any case, prior to using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose. You may provide your consent to us orally, in writing, by electronic communication, or any other means reasonably capable of conveying your consent.  We will obtain your express consent if we collect, use or disclose sensitive information. Your consent may also be intrinsic to the circumstances such as in the case where you have already provided personal information to us and you maintain your relationship with us or where you provide our representatives with your phone number so that we can contact you. Except when otherwise permitted by law, we will only use the information for the purpose for which it was given. From time to time, we may collect, utilize, or disclose your personal information based on your consent and as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<p>When your consent is required, you can withdraw consent at any time (unless withdrawing the consent would frustrate the performance of legal obligations) upon providing to us a 30-day notice. However, the withdrawal of your consent may adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to you and to maintain our relationship.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, as permitted or required by law, we may collect, use, or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent. These circumstances include (where applicable) information about individuals that is publicly available, where collection or use is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, to investigate a breach or a contravention of a law, to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or as required or otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<h4>THIRD PARTIES</h4>
<p>We remain responsible for all personal information communicated to third parties for processing. As such, we ensure that third parties that are engaged to provide products or services on our behalf and are provided with personal information are required to observe the intent of this Canadian Policy by having comparable levels of security protection or, when required, by assuring us (through a confidentiality agreement) that they will not use or disclosure the personal information for any purpose other than the purpose for which the personal information was communicated.</p>

<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
<p>We only collect the personal information necessary to fulfill the purposes identified to you prior to or at the time of collection, or any other reasonable and legitimate purposes or as required by law.</p>

<p>We do not use or disclose your personal information, except for the purposes for which it was collected, or new purposes to which you have consented, or as required or otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p>We do not, as a condition of supplying goods or services to you or on your behalf, or as an administrative or management requirement, require consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information beyond that reasonably required for such purposes, or to comply with its obligations under applicable law.</p>

<h4>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We may keep a record of your personal information, including correspondence or comments, in the applicable file specific to you. We will utilize, disclose, or retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and for legal or business requirements. We will establish minimum and maximum retention periods and procedures for maintaining and destroying your personal information.  When personal information is retained to make a decision about you, we will retain such information for one year.</p>

<h4>ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Subject to the exceptions provided by the applicable law, we will make available to you any specific personal information about you that we have collected, utilized or disclosed, upon your written request. We will make such information available to you in a form that is generally understandable, including explaining any abbreviations or codes and using an alternative format, if required. Simply send your request for access to the Privacy Officer listed below.  Please be as specific as possible in your request so that we can meet the applicable time lines.</p>

<h4>ACCURACY </h4>
<p>We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is kept as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as possible. We will not routinely update your personal information, unless such a process is necessary. In order to help us maintain and ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date, you must inform us, without delay, of any change in the information you provided to us.</p>

<p>You can at any time, challenge the accuracy or completeness of the personal information we have about you, subject to the exceptions provided by applicable law. If you successfully demonstrate that the personal information we have on you is inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend the personal information as required. Where appropriate, we will transmit the amended information to third parties to whom we have communicated your personal information.</p>

<h4>RESPONSE TIMES </h4>
<p>We will make every reasonable effort to respond to each of your written requests not later than 30 days after receipt of such requests. When applicable, we will advise you in writing if we cannot meet your requests within this time limit. When applicable, you have the right to make a complaint to the appropriate privacy commission with respect to this time limit.</p>

<h4>COSTS</h4>
<p>We expect to provide access without charge as a general matter.  However, we reserve the right to collect a reasonable charge when you request the transcription, reproduction, or transmission of such information. We will notify you, following your request for transcription, reproduction, or transmission, of the appropriate amount that will be charged. You will then have the opportunity to withdraw your request.</p>

<h4>IDENTIFICATION IN CONNECTION WITH REQUESTS</h4>
<p>We may require that you provide us with sufficient identification of your identify before we provide information about the existence, use, or disclosure of your personal information in our possession. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>

<h4>SAFEGUARDS</h4>
<p>We use security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of personal information to protect it from loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. These safeguards include physical measures, such as restricted access to offices and equipment, organizational measures, such as security clearances, and publishing this policy to appropriate personnel with instructions to act in accordance with its principles (for example, limiting access on a "need to know" basis), and technological measures, such as the use of passwords and/or encryption.</p>
